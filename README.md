## Real-Time Retail Analytics Dashboard üõçÔ∏è

This project is a real-time retail analytics dashboard built with Python, Streamlit, and YOLOv8.
It processes video feeds to provide business insights such as footfall count and customer dwell time in a specified Zone of Interest (ROI).
The dashboard helps retailers understand customer behavior and optimize store layouts.

# ‚ú® Features
- Interactive Web Dashboard
    Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface.
- Real-Time Person Detection
    Uses YOLOv8 for fast and accurate detection of people in video frames.
- Object Tracking
    Each detected person is assigned a unique ID to track their movement across frames.
- Zone of Interest (ROI)
    Define a polygonal area (e.g., entrance, aisle, promotion zone) to monitor activity.
- Footfall Counting
    Counts the number of unique individuals entering the ROI.
- Dwell Time Analysis
    Calculates how long each customer spends inside the ROI.
